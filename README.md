A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Description

This project focuses on machine translation and question answering tasks, leveraging advanced deep learning models. It is structured into two main components: Machine Translation (MT) and Question-Answering on the Natural Language Inference (QNLI).

### Machine Translation (MT)

The MT component explores different neural network architectures for translating text from one language to another. It includes:

- **RNN**: Implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks for machine translation.
- **Transformer**: Utilization of the Transformer model for more efficient translation.
- **FineTuning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific machine translation tasks.

Data for machine translation can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/NlpHUST/t5-en-vi-small).

### Question-Answering (QNLI)

The QNLI component focuses on fine-tuning and evaluating models on the Question-Answering Natural Language Inference task.

Data for the QNLI task can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue).
