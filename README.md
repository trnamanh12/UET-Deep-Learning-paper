A brief description of what this project does.

## Description

This project focuses on machine translation and question answering tasks, leveraging advanced deep learning models. It is structured into two main components: Machine Translation (MT) and Question-Answering on the Natural Language Inference (QNLI).

### Machine Translation (MT)

The MT component explores different neural network architectures for translating text from one language to another. It includes:

- **RNN**: Recurrent Neural Network-based MT models and related scripts.
- **Transformer**: Transformer-based MT models and related scripts.

- **FineTuning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific machine translation tasks.

Data for machine translation can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/NlpHUST/t5-en-vi-small).

### Question-Answering (QNLI)

**QNLI**: This subdirectory is dedicated to the Question Natural Language Inference (QNLI) task.

- **Finetuning**: Scripts and configurations for fine-tuning QNLI models.
- **RNN-QNLI**: Recurrent Neural Network-based QNLI models and related scripts.
- **S-BiDAF**: Scripts for the S-BiDAF model applied to QNLI tasks. ( Simplified-BiDAF)
- **S-QAnet**: Scripts for the S-QAnet model applied to QNLI tasks. ( Simplified-QAnet)

Data for the QNLI task can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nyu-mll/glue).
